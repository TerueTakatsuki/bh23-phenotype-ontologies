# Background

Ontologies play a crucial role in data management and especially in life science, they have been indispensable for decades as the complexity of life science data requires rigor. Biomedical ontologies often undergo change and improvement, as e.g. disease and phenotype ontologies develop constantly along with our scientific understanding. In order to bridge the gap between ontologies and annotated datasets and thus to semantically enable applications and datasets to retrieve insights and improve interoperability, ontology mapping plays a key role [1]. 

For example, as a role for search function interface, an ontology is used to absorb fluctuations in expression due to synonyms and to guide users through generalization/specialization. Links as rdfs:subClassOf, thereby contributing to clarifying users' interests and indicating users' desired search results. The use of links between terms may also be used to meet the needs of users across domains. For example, modern life sciences are strongly expected to contribute to medical science, but the phenotypic vocabulary used for many model organisms is different from that used in medical science. Mapping data between Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) [2, 10] and phenotypic ontologies of each model organism research field has been implemented in many databases to meet the needs of searches across research fields [3, 4, 5]. 

In addition to data searching, a bird's-eye understanding of the data set is important for scientists. Users not only want detailed information on individual pieces of information, they also want to know where their interest targets within their own research area. The need for good overview and easy understanding of the overall and partial structure of the data for clinicians and biologists working in a variety of fields is also a major challenge that cannot be ignored. Depending on the domain and site of use, synonyms and definitions can vary which would not be noticed without communication with the end users. Ontology can help understanding the domainâ€™s knowledge by providing vocabularies or terms with their classification and relationships.
 
To implement a sophisticated search supported by semantics, interoperability to address cross-disciplinary needs is crucial. In this paper we focus on different aspects of interoperability of ontologies, especially in the phenotype and disease domain and how they could be improved: 

One aspect is not technical but linguistic and social interoperability - improving the usage and understanding of datasets through translation of ontologies into other languages like Japanese. While this might not seem challenging at first from a scientific or mathematical perspective, it is actually a very challenging task as translations in general might introduce unacceptable fuzziness: An exact translation can be viewed similarly strict as a skos:exactMatch statement in ontology matching - but sometimes such an exact translation is not possible, especially for languages from different  families, e.g. Indo-Germanic, Japanese or Arabic. [Please see Background translations for more details on translation]   

Another aspect of this paper is the interoperability between the HPO and Mammalian Phenotype Ontology (MP) [ 7] on a technical and structural level. MP is a phenotype ontology provided by MGI [11]. These ontologies are very important to harmonise human data and model animal data, e.g., to maximise the outcome  from previous experiments with model organisms to minimise the sacrifice of animals. Ontology mapping  [see Background mappings] is a hard problem in general and especially in the case of HPO  and MP challenging  [see Outcome/other chapters LLM/ Gene expression/etc]. 

Because of this multifaceted nature of the problem, a multidisciplinary hackathon that includes not only linguists and informaticians, but also clinicians and life scientists, who are the most end-users, will provide an excellent opportunity to share current awareness and identify challenges for the future. During the BioHackJP 2023, a variety of approaches were discussed and evaluated. Focusing on the interoperability of the translation and mapping of ontologies, we discussed the following six issues:
 
1) Ontology translation to Japanese - current status and issues
2) Translation issue 2 - mappings between English and Japanese
3) HP-MP interoperability 1 - Differences of categorical layer dependent on view points
4) HP-MP interoperability 2 - definition analysis with LLM 
5) HP-MP interoperability 3 - LLM based Alignment workflow suggestions for axioms, labels and definitions
6) HP-MP interoperability 4 - Exploration of model mice relevant to human phenotypes and diseases


In this paper, we report overviews of the result of each investigation. And discussed future works to be addressed regarding these challenges.


# Outcomes

To achieve our objectives, we conducted a comprehensive survey of open source language models available and evaluated their suitability for our task. We explored different models, taking into consideration factors such as performance, computational requirements, and ease of deployment. Subsequently, we sought to run the selected models on a local computer, ensuring that the infrastructure requirements were met.

Having established a working environment for LLMs, we developed a set of pipelines that incorporated various natural language processing techniques to extract relevant biological terms from textual data. These terms were then matched and mapped to the corresponding ontology terms, thereby providing a standardized representation of the extracted information. By utilizing Linked Data principles, we aimed to create an interconnected network of biological knowledge that would facilitate data integration and enable advanced analysis.

# Future work

In this paper, we examine six critical issues related to ontology interoperability, translation to multiple languages, and the relationships among terms across diverse ontologies. These issues were probed during an international hackathon that assembled a varied set of researchers from distinct life science communities. Our findings underscore the interconnectedness of these issues and suggest that they require a comprehensive solution. One recommendation posits the need to redesign the hierarchical structure of ontologies. This restructuring aims to standardize translations across ontologies, establish accurate term relationships, and facilitate a high-level understanding of the ontology.  How to organize the layer is a big challenge, however, this is one of the fundamental problems exist in the every ontology. To address these issues we need to combine several methods including the compression of layers with terms based on the concept or newly annotated tag etc. 

We also observed the necessity for multi-dimensional improvements in interoperability that can transcend various domains such as species, disciplines, and both human-computer and computer-computer interactions. Although many software applications have adopted ontology visualization based on rdfs:subClassOf links, this approach is often inadequate for biomedical researchers. The field of ontology research acknowledges that human understanding varies across different categorical layers, influenced by perspective and context. Despite existing research on dynamic data structures and methodologies, the biomedical sector still lacks extensive, user-friendly ontology tools. Therefore, the development of intuitive visualization software, along with the refinement of ontology knowledge structures, is imperative.


To address these challenges, we advocate for the development of next-generation ontologies that incorporate machine learning and language models. These advanced systems could offer flexible, specialized information while maintaining a comprehensive and holistic view of the knowledge base.

The utilization of Lexical Language Models (LLMs) is a forthcoming imperative task. Specifically, the integration of lexical and semantic (axiom) components in mapping strategies could be beneficial. As a part of our quantitative evaluation, we intend to measure 'ChatGPT distance' to assess semantic similarity, combining natural language and logical definitions, such as EQ models in ontologies. This evaluation will contribute to the effectiveness of the existing HPO-MP mapping data, currently used for research on mice and other model organisms relevant to human phenotypes and diseases. It will also facilitate the alignment of various ontologies and the application of new mappings for disease modeling and gene-disease associations. Moreover, an exploration of the relationships among translations, axioms, and LLM embeddings may enhance coordination between phenotype ontology developers, software engineers, and end-users in biomedical science.
In conclusion, the hackathon reaffirmed that interdisciplinary collaborations could offer diverse perspectives on a problem, thereby facilitating more comprehensive solutions. Technological advancements in this domain, including the use of LLMs, are promising and likely to provide innovative solutions to the challenges discussed herein.  The next Hackathon will continue to serve as platforms for discussing these complex issues and identifying potential solutions.
